                <p>I develop user friendly, yet aesthetically pleasing solutions to design problems, and build them with <a href="">HTML5</a> &amp; <a href="">CSS3</a>. I design responsive layouts with a heavy focus on user experience (UX). Here are some more words about me.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>I utilise server-side languages such as <a href="">PHP</a> and popular frameworks such as <a href="">Laravel</a> to develop enterprise level products for small and large scale projects. I also work on a number of <a href="http://github.com/jamieshepherd">open source projects.</a></p>
